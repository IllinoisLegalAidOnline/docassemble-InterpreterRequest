  Interpreter request
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Interpreter request** program.

  This program will make a form to request an interpreter to help you or someone else understand what is being said in court.

  The form you create with this program can only be used in Illinois.
field: sees_nav_bar

id: instructions
continue button field: how_to_use
question: |
  Instructions
subquestion: |
  You can use this program to create a form requesting a court interpreter.

  Set aside 5 to 10 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 

  Once you complete the program, you can download your form and instructions. You should ask the Circuit Clerk for the court how they would like you to submit your interpreter request.
  
  **Note:** A translator may not be available immediately after you request one. You may want to submit your interpreter request as soon as possible to make sure the court has time to get an interpreter. Some courts may require advanced notice.
  
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some questions have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0DCAF0" ) } that also gives help.
